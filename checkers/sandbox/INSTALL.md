1. Install Python 3 and pip for it. Python 3.8 or higher is needed.
I.e. on debian-based hosts run `apt install python3 python3-pip` 

2. Install requirements for the checker:
`pip3 install -Ur requirements.txt`

   (Or just `pip` instead of `pip3` on Windows or in virtual environments with Python 3)
